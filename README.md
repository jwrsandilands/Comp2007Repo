# Comp2007Repo
Code Work for Comp2007

# Description
All of the assets used in the game were produced by myself, with exception to those created by default, and the text font used 
(The font asset can be accessed via https://www.dafont.com/i-pixel-u.font.)

The unity scenes and assets are kept within "2007 - CW Street Scene"

The finished build of the game is both in this repository (outside of the project files under "builds") and available for download on Itch.io to those who have the page link.
